awk '/^\\end{verbatim}/{x=0}x;/^\\begin{verbatim}/{x=1}' |\
	sed '/^[A-Z]*=/! s/\([^\\;]\)$/\1 \&/'
echo wait

# explanation:
# AWK extracts the lines of the document betwen verbatim environments
# SED adds "&" at the end of each line, unless the line ends with ";" or "\"
# or it is a variable assignement
# ECHO prints "wait" at the very end
