To study a geometric object~$M$, people often use regular functions
between~$M$ and spaces with well-known properties, such as~$\R^n$,~$\T^n$
or~$S^n$.  The resulting spaces of functions have an algebraic structure
whose properties correspond to geometric properties of~$M$.  Typically,
families of functions of the form~$X^n\to M$ constitute a sequence of groups
(homology, homotopy), and the structure of these groups and their quotients
provides a lot of geometrical information about~$M$.  On the other hand,
families of functions~$M\to X^n$ form a sequence of vector spaces
(cohomology) whose dimensions and quotients give geometrical information
about~$M$, in a different, often easier to interpret form.

The easiest example is the algebraic definition of~\emph{connexity}.  Imagine
that~$M$ has~$n$ connected components.  How can we recover~$n$ using this kind
of algebra?
%
Via cohomology: consider the set of smooth functions~$M\to\R$ whose
derivative is zero.  This set is a vector space of dimension~$n$.
Notice that this is the quotient space of the set of all smooth functions,
modulo its subspace defined by a linear condition~$df=0$.
%
Via homology: consider the free abelian group generated by all paths~$[0,1]^1\to
M$.  The boundary of such a path is defined the difference between its two endpoints, which is an element of the free group generated by all points~$[0,1]^0\to M$.  The quotient of two such groups is isomorphic to~$\Z^n$.

Functions~$\R\to M$ are thus called~\emph{paths} or~\emph{walks},
or~\emph{trajectories}.  And functions~$M\to\R$ will be called
called~\emph{signals}, or simply~\emph{functions}.

In this note we recall the main definitions of ``geometric signal processing''
That is, we study the many operations that can be performed with sets of
functions of the form~$M\to\X^n$.  We just give the definitions and the main
main results; no proofs nor lengthy interpretations.
