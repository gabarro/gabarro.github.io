philosophy:

0. PIXEL IS KING: the terminal window is a grid of pixels
1. NO BLURRY FONTS: only monospace bitmap fonts are supported
2. NO SCALING: a pixel is a pixel.  If your text is too small, use a larger font
3. NO GPU: the terminal runs in a single cpu thread
4. NO LIBRARIES: compile it with 0 dependencies and dump output to ppm files
5. NATIVE IMAGES: direct access to the terminal framebuffer via control codes
6. NATIVE VECTOR PRIMITIVES: for simple in-band plotting (segment, polygon)
7. MOCK XTERM: built silently on top of TERM=xterm-256color, no terminfo
8. LIMITED ENVELOPE: can run bash, vim, tmux, bpython and that's it
